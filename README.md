The goal of this task is to create a body for BaseClass.

BaseClass should implement validations like ActiveRecord does.
Every class inheriting from BaseClass should be able to use validations. Look at item.rb for example usage of validations.

You can check that your solution works by running the test suite in item_test.rb.

Remember that the aim of this task is to write nice, universal code that will work with other parameters.
We will be judging your overall approach & creativity, so attached test works only as kind of specification.
We can accept partial solutions if the overall idea was right.
